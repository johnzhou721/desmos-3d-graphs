# desmos-3d-graphs
Some of my Desmos 3D Graphs. Maintained in DesModder Text Mode BETA format.

## Usage

Install DesModer, Go to https://www.desmos.com/3d, Click the DesModer button, Core -> Text Mode BETA -- ON, click on the T icon, paste in the plain text comments from .desmos files. .desmos is not an actual file format, just use it as plain text.

Animate the t or t_ime variables.

Note: Roughness of branches is a rendering error. No real roughness is implemented. The snow drops are stopped using a conical plane that approximates the bottom branches but is not exact, so expect rare floating snowdrops.

Various forms of rockets etc. that are NOT accurate models. Lots of rendering issues from a far distance, and due to banned compound inequalities workarounds have to be made w/ square roots to restrict range.
